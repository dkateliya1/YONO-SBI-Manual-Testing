# YONO-SBI-Manual-Testing
Manual testing project for the YONO SBI mobile application covering core banking features. Designed and executed 250+ test cases across 14 modules, including functional, negative, boundary, UI/UX, network, and security scenarios. Maintained RTM and Bug/Enhancement sheets for full test coverage and traceability.


# Brief description

This repository contains a comprehensive Manual Testing project executed on the YONO SBI mobile application, focusing on validating functionality, usability, security, and performance of a large-scale digital banking platform used by millions of users.

The application was tested across 14 major functional modules, including Login & MPIN, User Onboarding, Account Overview, Balance & Mini Statement, Fund Transfer (Within SBI / Other Banks), Beneficiary Management, Bill Payments, Mobile Recharge, Transaction History, Profile Management, Notifications, Session Handling, Logout, and Error Handling.

For each module, 18+ detailed test cases were designed and executed, resulting in approximately 250+ total test cases. Test coverage includes:

Functional testing of core banking flows

Negative and boundary scenarios (invalid inputs, limits, failures)

UI/UX testing (readability, button reachability, alignment)

Network testing (no network, low network, switching Wi-Fi to mobile data)

Interrupt testing (calls, notifications, app background/foreground)

Compatibility testing across devices and OS versions

A formal Test Plan and Test Strategy were created to define scope, testing approach, risks, assumptions, and entry/exit criteria. A detailed Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) was maintained to map requirements with test cases and linked defects, ensuring 100% requirement coverage.

All defects were logged in a structured Bug & Enhancement Sheet, capturing Defect ID, linked Test Case ID, severity, priority, status, and classification (Bug vs Enhancement). This ensured clear traceability between testing efforts and quality outcomes.

This project demonstrates strong expertise in mobile application manual testing, banking domain knowledge.
